                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>
                       I am a curious, motivated, and hardworking individual who enjoys learning about business, technology, and real estate. I study Management Information Systems at the University of Arizona, specializing in Accounting and Finance. I have a strong interest in how data and technology can transform complex problems into practical solutions. I am always looking for ways to grow, challenge myself, and apply analytical thinking both inside and outside the classroom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       I take pride in being thoughtful, positive, and dependable. I enjoy helping others and finding ways to make a team stronger. Working with my father on a rental renovation and tenant placement project taught me how to analyze markets, manage responsibilities, and stay patient when things get difficult. These experiences shaped my belief that success comes from curiosity, reliability, and consistent effort.
                    <p>
                      In a professional setting, my goal is to combine business analytics, technology, and investment strategy to make smarter real estate and portfolio decisions. I am developing these skills through my project, RentalVestor, which helps investors evaluate rental property performance using data-driven insights. My core values of being technological, reliable, and analytical guide everything I do. I strive to lead with integrity, adapt through innovation, and deliver measurable results.

                                In my Business Analytics class, I worked on a project that analyzed Amazon’s online profitability. My team used real data to study how costs, prices, and customer growth affected profits. We built charts and models to see which factors had the biggest impact on performance and suggested ways Amazon could improve efficiency and increase revenue. This project helped me learn how to use data to solve real business problems and make clear, practical recommendations. My team received over a 95% on this project.

                                RentalVestor is a website I created to help real estate investors make smarter decisions. It lets users analyze rental properties by entering key information like purchase price, rent, taxes, and expenses. The site then calculates important metrics such as cash flow, return on investment, and cap rate. I built it to combine my interest in business analytics and real estate, using data to show investors how different factors affect profitability. RentalVestor makes it easier for people to understand the financial performance of rental properties before they invest.

I partnered with my father to invest in a rental property where I helped manage the renovation, budgeting, and tenant placement process. I analyzed local market data, including home prices, rent levels, and vacancy rates, to choose a strong investment location. During the project, I learned how to balance expenses with expected returns and how to make data-driven decisions about pricing and improvements. This experience gave me a hands-on understanding of real estate investing, property management, and how analytics can be used to increase long-term value.

                                I’m proud to share that I’ve made the Dean’s List several times, including Full Time, Honorable Mention, and with Distinction. These awards show my hard work and determination through my academic journey. I always try to learn more, improve each day, and stay focused on my goals. Winning a university case competition also helped me build strong communication and strategy skills. Working with my team to analyze business options and give a clear presentation taught me how to think creatively and lead with confidence.

                            <h3>Case Competition Winner</h3>
                            <p>
                                During my Fall 2024 semester, I had the opportunity to participate in a case competition where we analyzed whether a coffee shop should add a patio or a drive-thru. My group chose the patio option and developed a detailed and visually engaging presentation. We proposed several innovative ideas to boost profits, including introducing a rewards app. This experience significantly enhanced my presentation skills and better prepared me for future projects.

                        <p>
                            The RentalVestor website project connects to my core value of being technological because I built the entire website myself from the ground up. I used coding, design, and data tools to create interactive calculators and dashboards that help users analyze rental properties. Developing RentalVestor taught me how to apply technology to solve real business problems and make data accessible to others. It shows how I use innovation, coding, and analytics together to turn ideas into functional digital tools that create real value.

                        <p>

                           The Rental Property project with my father connects to my core value of being reliable because I took responsibility for managing important parts of the investment. I stayed consistent through the renovation, budgeting, and tenant placement process to make sure everything ran smoothly. My father and I relied on each other to make smart decisions, and I made sure my work was accurate and on time. By handling challenges carefully and keeping my word, I showed that reliability builds trust and leads to real results in business and teamwork.

                        <p>
                            This Amazon Profit Analysis project connects to my core value of being analytical because I used data to understand real business problems. I analyzed Amazon’s costs, prices, and customer growth to see how each factor affected profitability. I built charts and models to find patterns, tested different ideas, and made data-driven recommendations to improve performance. This experience strengthened my ability to think critically, interpret numbers, and turn data into clear insights and solutions.
